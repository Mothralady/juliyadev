Earlier in the Summer, I decided to create a game studio with my friend, Janine. We were to call it **Redheads**, which is why you might see a link to it at the bottom of my website.

Unfortunately, things did not pan out. I became overworked and overwhelmed trying to do everything at once. I then decided, what if I restarted **Heavy Network** - a project dedicated to providing free static websites to local *unsigned* musicians. I started Heavy in 2017, my first band being **Monte Luna** in Austin, Texas. Sad to say Monte Luna broke my only rule - that bands remain unsigned to a record label if they wanted my services. Suffice to say I was disheartened after all that. But my dream of helping independent musicians in my city persisted.

So now I am dedicating my free dev time completely to what I started Heavy Network to do, but without a company or plans to grow or prosper. It will be something I do in my spare time, for nothing at all.

If you are interested in a website from me, and are an _unsigned_ musician in Texas, please [**email me**](mailto:juliyagannon@proton.me). Check the homepage on my website to see if I am currently accepting new bands.

It is no one's fault but my own. I take full accountability for not being able to handle such an intense workload. I was trying to learn everything at once, doing everything at once. I didn't have a good system in place for me. But now I do. I realize how important it is that I limit my dev work to only a few days a week to stay sane.

In better news, *tomorrow I am 12 years sober*! I am celebrating with my husband, Eirik, and my mother (Happy Birthday mom!)
Expect at least one blog post a month from me, maybe ramp it up later. Cause who reads blogs anymore? They're usually lame and boring. I hope you enjoy my blog even if it's just to cringe :D
